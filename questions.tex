\section{Determination of questions arising at general meetings}
\label{rule:questions}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A question arising at a general meeting of the Association is to be determined on a show of hands.
	\item A declaration by the chairperson that a resolution has, on a show of hands, been lost or carried, or been carried unanimously or carried by a particular majority, together with an entry to that effect in the minute book of the Association, is evidence of that fact unless a poll is demanded on or before that declaration.
\end{enumerate}
