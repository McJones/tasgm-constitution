# Tasmanian Game Makers Association Constitution

This is the TeX source files for the constitution of the [Tasmanian Game Makers society](https://tasgamemakers.com).
The document should be fully hyperlinked both internally and externally.

The majority of this is based upon the [Associations Incorporation Model Rules](https://www.legislation.tas.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sr-2017-072#JS1@EN) and could be used as the basis of your own Tasmanian association constitution if so desired.

Issues with the constitution TeX files such as broken links or typos should be reported [here as issues](https://github.com/McJones/tasgm-constitution/issues/), concerns around TasGM itself should [go directly to the society](https://tasgamemakers.com).
